# Data Guide

In all cases whilst compiling this data we have been careful to include as much meta-information as possible to allow data to be traced back to it's original sources. For SuperCon this takes the form of the SuperCon "num :" reference id and then the source publication for ICSD we provide the ICSD collection code.

We acknowledge the huge efforts of The Japanese National Institute for Materials Science for maintaining the [SuperCon](https://supercon.nims.go.jp/index_en.html) database as well as FIZ Karlsruhe GmbH for maintaining [ICSD](https://www.fiz-karlsruhe.de/en/produkte-und-dienstleistungen/inorganic-crystal-structure-database-icsd). 

## super_cuprates

This is a processed data set of cuprates identified from the SuperCon data set.

## super_cleaned

This is the subset of all the cuprates for which lattice information was available.

## super_apical

This is the subset of all the cuprates for which lattice information and sufficient reference data were available. Estimates of the apical and in-plane distances are given.

## super_top

This is the subset of all the cuprates for which lattice information and sufficient reference data were available that are believed to be optimally oxygen doped. Estimates of the apical and in-plane distances are given.

## icsd_cuprates

This is a processed data set containig apical and in-plane distances for cuprate materials identified by filtering the ICSD database.

## icsd_cleaned

This is the subset of materials that were identified as being consistent with the supercon data set.

## icsd_removed

This is the subset of materials that was identified as being anomalous with respect to the supercon data set.
